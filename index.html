    <h2> About Myself</h3>

        <p id="main"> My name is Vivian, and I am currently a <b> senior </b> at Northeastern University, set to <b>
                graduate this May. </b> This semester, I am taking four classes: Machine Learning 2, Data Visualization,
            Entrepreneurship and Startups, and Creating Value with AI. In addition to my coursework, I am a Teaching
            Assistant for two innovation-focused classes, where I assist with grading assignments, exams, and homework.
            <br>
            <br>
            Beyond academics, I am gaining hands-on experience as a <i> part-time Business Development Lead </i> at a
            startup called Powerhouse. In this role, I am researching potential secondary markets that the company aims
            to expand into beyond its initial target market. Alongside my studies and work, I am also actively job
            searching for full-time opportunities in marketing, product management, or analytics.
            <br>
            <br>
            After graduation, I will be going on a graduation trip with my friends. We plan to travel to Japan, Taiwan,
            and Bali.
